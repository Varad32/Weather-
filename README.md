# Weather Data Analysis and Rain Prediction in Australia

Introduction
This notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of weather data from different areas of Australia and aims to build a binary classification model to predict whether it will rain tomorrow. The dataset used for this task is a midsized collection of weather records, which provides valuable insights into the weather patterns and allows us to develop a machine learning model for rain prediction.
