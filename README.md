# Weather Data Analysis and Rain Prediction in Australia

Introduction
This notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of weather data from different areas of Australia and aims to build a binary classification model to predict whether it will rain tomorrow. The dataset used for this task is a midsized collection of weather records, which provides valuable insights into the weather patterns and allows us to develop a machine learning model for rain prediction.

Understanding and predicting weather conditions are of great importance in various domains, such as agriculture, transportation, and urban planning. Accurate rain prediction can assist in making informed decisions, mitigating risks, and optimizing resource allocation. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can analyze historical weather data and develop models that effectively predict the occurrence of rain.
